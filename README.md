# Java-Hollow_Square-Patterns
This Java program prints a hollow square star pattern of user-defined size. It prompts the user to enter the square's size and uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns. If the size is even, it prints stars at the square's boundary and spaces inside, forming a hollow shape.
